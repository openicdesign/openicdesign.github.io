title: Analog
---

I stepped fully into the analog world in 2013 and have spent the last decade
trying to simplify how we make analog circuits. I am obsessed with finding or
building tools that accelerate the design process because every hour saved on
setup or verification is another hour I can spend exploring new architectures.
I'm still firmly on this journey—always learning, always tuning the flow, aiming
for a little more "Excelsior" every day.


Along the way I've created some open source IPs, and I'm learning to leverage
other open tools and projects so the community's work keeps expanding my own
expertise.


## [aicex](/aicex)

Collection of IPs in Skywater 130 nm


## [dicex](https://github.com/wulffern/dicex)

A bunch of examples, SPICE, SystemVerilog, synthesis. I used
this when I tought Design of Integrated Circuits.
